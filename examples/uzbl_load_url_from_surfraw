# This script attempts to be the ultimate url opening script for UZBL. It
# hopes to do this in the following way. It presents all surfraw bookmarks
# and elvi in a dmenu, and uses surfraw to obtain a valid URL. If the first
# word entered by the user (and thus returned by dmenu) contains a colon (:)
# or a period (.), it assumes that the user entered a valid URL and just
# immediately prints that, bypassing surfraw.
#
# As such, the script itself is stupid, and the awesomeness comes from dmenu
# and surfraw.
#
# Example UZBL configuration:
#
# To open any url in the current UZBL instance:
# bind    o         = sh 'uri=`$XDG_DATA_HOME/uzbl/scripts/uzbl_load_url_from_surfraw` && echo "uri $uri" > $4'
# To open any url in a new UZBL instance:
# bind    t         = sh 'uri=`$XDG_DATA_HOME/uzbl/scripts/uzbl_load_url_from_surfraw` && uzbl --uri $uri'
